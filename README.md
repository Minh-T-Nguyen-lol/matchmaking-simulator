# Java Matchmaking Simulator
- Small, dependency-free Java matchmaking simulator that exposes a tiny HTTP API to submit players and query matches. It uses the JDK com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer (no external libs). 
- Matchmaking logic groups players by similar skill rating into matches of configurable size.
